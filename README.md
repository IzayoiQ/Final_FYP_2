## Testing & Performance

- **Single Allergen Detection**: Tested with 10 images for individual allergens.
- **Multi-Allergen Detection**: Evaluated with 50 images containing two or three allergens each.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Response Time: Quick results from upload to detection.
  - Accuracy: Minimum 90% detection accuracy achieved.
  - Error Rate: Optimized for precise multi-allergen detection.
